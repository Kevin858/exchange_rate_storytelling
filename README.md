# Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates

## Goals

We will utilize explanatory data visualization to demostate the data storytelling skills on following:

- How to use information design principles (familiarity and maximizing the data-ink ratio) to create better graphs for an audience.
- About the elements of a story and how to create storytelling data visualizations using Matplotlib.
- How to create visual patterns using Gestalt principles.
- How to guide the audience's attention with pre-attentive attributes.
- How to use Matplotlib built-in styles — with a case study on the FiveThirtyEight style.

To make learning more efficient, we learned about each of these topics one at a time. In this guided project, we'll go one step further and combine these skills.

## Dataset

The dataset we'll use describes Euro daily exchange rates between 1999 and 2021. The euro (symbolized with €) is the official currency in most of the countries of the European Union.

Daria Chemkaeva put together the data set and made it available on Kaggle — the data source is the European Central Bank. Note that the dataset gets regular updates — we downloaded it on January 2021.
